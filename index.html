      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <h4>My name is Kieffer Reitenbach â€”</h4>
      <p>From a young age I have always been fascinated by the arts and design. I started studying in traditional arts including drawing and painting but now study Graphic Design. Throughout the years many interests of mine have inspired my style and creative mind. My style has very much evolved throughout the years, maturing into something that I can be proud of. I have always found inspiration in anything retro or vintage. This includes retro video games, classic cars, and vintage electronics. The colours that are associated with these things I have always enjoyed playing around with and making my own. While taking inspiration from these I continue to add a modern flair to my work to further solidify my style in a world full of them. This website is somewhat of a portfolio as well as somewhere to share my design process and thoughts behind certain ideas. Please feel free to contact me for any follow up questions or comments</p>
